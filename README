GETTING STARTED
---------------

You can run a simple GOES server with this command:

go run simpleserver/simpleserver.go --db=./events --addr=tcp://127.0.0.1:12345

Both flags are optional and their default values are the same as the example.

Notes
-----

- On Windows, zmq4 requires Administrative privileges to bind the socket (not sure why, probably related to integrated encryption features in zmq4)
